        <p>The American Quarter Horse breed is among Americaâ€™s most popular and oldest breeds. In the 1600s, American colonials began to cross English Thoroughbred horses with "native" horses such as the Chickasaw, a breed developed and propagated by the Chickasaw Indians. One of the most famous examples of crossbreeding involved Janus, a Thoroughbred and grandson to Godolphin Arabian, one of the founding stallions of the modern Thoroughbred bloodstock. </p>
            <br>
          <p>  Janus was brought to Virginia in 1752 and his breeding resulted in a smaller, more robust and agile American Quarter Horse. (Interestingly, Thoroughbreds are still used today to improve Quarter Horse's stock and running ability. The American Quarter Horse would later become very popular in races, especially as it beat pure Thoroughbreds in short races, such as the quarter mile. Its predominance in quarter-mile races is actually the reason why it is called the Quarter Horse.
